<h1>Team Manager</a></h1>
<p>Team Manager is an extended version of a SoftUni workshop that I developed in the JavaScript Apps module, incorporating additional functionalities.</p>
<p>This project marks my first ever deployed app, where I utilized Firebase as the backend infrastructure and I used their hosting service as well, primarily to enhance my learning experience.</p>
